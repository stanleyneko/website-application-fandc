      <p class="about__text">
        My name is Mio Ebisu. I am a painter and an LQA game tester. I studied painting at Musashino Art University in
        Tokyo and
        the University of the Arts London. Over the years, I have exhibited my work in solo and group exhibitions and
        participated in artist residencies internationally. The scroll galleries are examples of my work.

        I live on a narrowboat moored in the River Lea with my partner, our one-year-old daughter, and our black cat. My
        hobbies
        include visiting hot springs, enjoying Finnish saunas, reading manga,wild plants foraging and actually, learning
        is my hobby. <br>

    <h1 class="js-show-text">Why I want to move into a career as a web developer?</h1>
    <h2 class="about__text">
      Building a technical career:
    </h2>
    <p class="about__text">
      I have been working as a painter since 2012 and represented artist by a gallery. Most of my work is in private
      collections. However, the financial situation is always tough. I have had many different jobs over the years ‚Äì
      working
      as a chef, a bartender, a tester at a credit card company, internship at Gundom shops , home deco contents writer,
      and
      LQA game tester. While I gave my best in all these roles, I wanted a career where I could build on my skills over
      time.

      I have few friends who are programmers who also work in creative industries, so they inspired me. The more you
      code, the
      more experienced you become. The skills are specialized and technical. It is a skill that can contribute to any
      project and
      people. I realized that I wanted to be someone who can write code too. I started learning programming when I was
      pregnant.
    </p>

    <h2 class="about__text">
      A love for learning:
    </h2>
    <p class="about__text">
      I have explored different areas of tech introduction level, including backend development, cloud computing,
      automation, IoT and web development. Firstly, I doubted whether I would enjoy coding and would not give up,
      because I come from very different background. To challenge this, I started with non-visual aspects of
      programming,
      testing whether I still found interests in learning without colour or shapes. And I did.

      I love the feeling of understanding something new and imagining a future where I can apply these skills to
      real-world scenario. Also I love the moment that I didn't understand this to I got it!
    </p>
    <h2 class="about__text">
      Problem-solving:
    </h2>
    <p class="about__text">
      I have started working at a game testing company to enter the IT industry.The testing job was the most fun job
      ever done, finding bugs, thinking of wider scope to why it occurs. When I found the reason and received the fixed
      version, it was such a satisfying feeling. The job gives me confidence that I am going in the right direction.
    </p>

    <h2 class="about__text">
      Challenging unconscious bias:
    </h2>
    <p class="about__text">
      Japan, my home country, still has a big gender gap in the tech industry(all sectors though). If I had never heard
      of organizations like Django Girls and Code First Girls - groups that encourage women to enter tech - I took
      their workshops as a participant - I might
      have still assumed that programming was not for me. As well as Founders and Coders. When I read their Code of
      Conduct that makes me feel very welcomed and secured.<br>

      I am a volunteer Japanese translator for Raspberry Pi Foundation, helping make Scratch educational resources more
      accessible to children. Becoming a web developer is not just about my career - it's about using my skills to
      empower others.
    </p>

    <h2 class="about__text">
      A rewarding application process:
    </h2>
    <p class="about__text">
      Finally, I want to say how much I have enjoyed this application process. Knowing somebody will look at my practice
      and the deadline pushed me harder. The
      biggest challenge was creating a game. I could not believe I could finish it but I did - and I love it. <br>

      (I have messed up with the Git commit for this project. I have commit to the wrong repository.... the
      commit history looks pretty quiet and inactive for this reason.) <br>
      Thank you for reading my storyüêô
